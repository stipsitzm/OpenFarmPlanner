# Work Hours OpenFarmPlanner

Overview of work hours on the OpenFarmPlanner project based on Git commits and GitHub interactions.

**Note:** This tracking system uses activity bridging with a 3-hour gap threshold. All GitHub activities (commits, PR comments, issue comments, reviews) within 3 hours are considered part of the same work session.
