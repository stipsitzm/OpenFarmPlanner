        Only LocationViewSet opts into `ensure_default_location`, so this
        races specifically when two requests to /api/locations/ land close
        together for a brand-new project (e.g. the app's own initial GET list
        alongside an explicit POST creating the first location) — both see no
        location yet and both try to create one. Under SQLite this
        read-then-write is prone to "database is locked": ATOMIC_REQUESTS
        holds the write lock for a request's *entire* duration (not just this
        check), so a losing request can end up waiting out another request's
        full processing/serialization time, not just a quick DB write —
        easily longer than a couple hundred ms under CI load. Each attempt
        runs in its own savepoint so a failed attempt only rolls back that
        savepoint (not the whole request); the backoff is generous enough to
        outlast a competing request's full lifecycle, after which our
        `exists()` check sees its location and we return without duplicating
        it.
