# Frontend E2E Tests

Playwright end-to-end tests for OpenFarmPlanner frontend flows.

## Run

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:e2e
```

## Notes

- The Playwright configuration starts the backend and frontend web servers automatically.
- The frontend server is the **production build** served via `vite preview`, not the Vite
  dev server: `npm run test:e2e` runs `npm run build` first, and Playwright's `webServer`
  entry only runs `vite preview` against the resulting `dist/`. This is intentional — it
  catches production-only bugs (e.g. effect-ordering/timing issues that only show up once
  code is bundled) that the dev server can mask. If you change frontend source and re-run
  `npx playwright test` directly (skipping `npm run test:e2e`), remember to `npm run build`
  first, or your changes won't be reflected.
- A debug-only backend fixture endpoint is available only when:
  - `DEBUG=True`
  - `E2E_TEST_TOKEN` is set for the backend process started by Playwright
- `FRONTEND_PORT` and `BACKEND_PORT` env vars override the default ports (4173 / 8000) if
  you need to run E2E tests alongside an already-running dev environment.

See `frontend/playwright.config.ts` for exact runtime settings. In CI, the
`E2E (production build)` workflow (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) runs this same build+test
flow on every pull request targeting `main`.


## Responsive screenshot baseline

Run responsive visual baselines:

```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright test e2e/responsive-layouts.spec.ts
```

Update screenshots intentionally:

```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright test e2e/responsive-layouts.spec.ts --update-snapshots
```

Notes:
- Viewports covered: `375x800`, `768x900`, `1024x900`, `1440x900`.
- Route coverage: dashboard, standorte, anbauflaechen, kulturen, anbauplaene, anbaukalender, saatgutbedarf, lieferanten.
- Helpers are in `e2e/utils.ts` for deterministic login, viewport presets, and stable-page waiting.
