# Crop Library hooks

Empty on purpose for now. Reserved for hooks that are purely about crop
library data (browsing, searching a `Crop`) with no project/planting-plan
context. `frontend/src/pages/usePublicCultureLibrary.ts` deliberately stays
in `pages/` rather than moving here: it also publishes a project's `Culture`
into the library and imports a `Crop` back into the active project, so it's
the Farm Planning-side integration hook, not a Crop Library one — see
docs/crop-library-architecture.md.
