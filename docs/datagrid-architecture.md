# DataGrid Architecture

OpenFarmPlanner builds most editable tables on `EditableDataGrid`
(`frontend/src/components/data-grid/DataGrid.tsx`), a wrapper around MUI X
`<DataGrid>`. This doc covers what OpenFarmPlanner *added* on top of the
stock grid. It intentionally does not repeat:

- keyboard focus regions and the global shortcut system —
  [keyboard-architecture.md](./keyboard-architecture.md)
- autosave-on-blur mechanics — `AUTOSAVE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- the Standort/Parzelle/Beet tree view (a *different*, raw `<DataGrid>`
  page, not `EditableDataGrid`) — [occupancy-tree-hierarchy.md](./occupancy-tree-hierarchy.md)

**Not every table uses `EditableDataGrid`.** `FieldsBedsHierarchy.tsx`
renders a raw MUI `<DataGrid>` with its own row-data wiring and keyboard
navigation (`useHierarchyContextMenu.ts`). It shares the generic context
menu state/shell pieces with `EditableDataGrid`, but still has separate
trigger conditions and hierarchy-specific actions — when you change one,
check whether the other needs the same fix, but don't assume every layer is
shared.

## Imperative API (`EditableDataGridCommandApi`)

A page passes a `commandApiRef` into `EditableDataGrid`; the grid populates
it on mount (`hooks/useDataGridCommandApi.ts`):

```ts
interface EditableDataGridCommandApi {
  addRow, editSelectedRow, deleteSelectedRow, deleteRow(rowId),
  getSelectedRowId, setDraftValues(rowId, values), commitDraftValues(rowId, values),
  reload, focusTable, openRowById(rowId, { startEdit? }),
}
```

`openRowById(rowId, { startEdit })` is the deep-link entry point: it scrolls
to and selects a row, optionally opening edit mode. Today only
`PlantingPlans.tsx` uses it — the Gantt calendar's context menu
("Anbauplan öffnen" / "bearbeiten") navigates to
`/app/planting-plans?planId=<id>&edit=true`, and `PlantingPlans.tsx` resolves
that param to `openRowById(planId, { startEdit: true })`. This deliberately
replaced an earlier `initialRow`-based approach, which always prefilled a
**new draft row** — clicking "open" on an existing task used to silently
create a duplicate-looking blank plan instead of opening the one clicked.
If you add deep-linking into another grid page, this is the reference
pattern to follow, not a one-off to reinvent.

For large editable flat tables, `EditableDataGrid` also supports
`scrollMode="continuous"`. This keeps the free MUI DataGrid's internal page
size at 100 rows, hides the pager UI, and advances the internal row window
from wheel/touch scrolling so the table behaves like a continuous virtualized
scroll area. The full row array remains in component state, so sorting,
filtering, copy operations, and page-level mobile mirrors still operate on
the complete loaded dataset.

Continuous scroll uses `hooks/useScrollDrivenRowWindow.ts` for the internal
100-row window and `hooks/useStableDataGridScrollbar.ts` for the visible
thumb. The same stable-scrollbar hook is re-exported for the raw
Standort/Parzelle/Beet hierarchy so both large table styles keep matching
scrollbar behavior without parallel implementations; both also render the
track/thumb overlay itself through the shared `StableScrollbarTrack.tsx`
rather than each page hand-rolling the same absolutely-positioned Boxes.

`StableScrollbarTrack` must be rendered as a sibling of whatever wrapper Box
scrolls the table horizontally, not nested inside it — its `right: 0` is
relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, so nesting it inside content
that can be wider than the visible viewport (e.g. `surfaceSizing="contentFit"`)
pins it to the *content's* right edge instead of the *viewport's*, letting it
scroll out of view as the user scrolls the table horizontally.

`setDraftValues`/`commitDraftValues` let external code push field values
into a row that's already mid-edit (e.g. a calculated side-effect from
another field), either staying in edit mode or committing immediately.

## Custom edit cells

MUI's stock edit cells didn't fit a few OpenFarmPlanner-specific needs:

- **`AreaM2EditCell` / `PlantsCountEditCell`** — both preserve the raw text
  the user is typing (including a mid-typed decimal separator or a
  temporarily invalid/partial value) instead of coercing on every
  keystroke like MUI's built-in number editor does; normalization happens
  at save time, not on each keypress.
- **`DateEditCell`** (the default for any `type: 'date'` column, applied
  automatically by `dataGridUtils.tsx`'s `applyDefaultDateEditCell`) — a
  from-scratch segmented `TT.MM.JJJJ` editor: per-segment cursor tracking,
  Up/Down arrows increment/decrement the active day/month/year segment
  (with correct month-length/rollover handling), Left/Right move between
  segments, plus a hidden native `<input type="date">` behind a calendar
  icon as a picker fallback.
- **`GermanDateEditCell.tsx`** no longer exports an edit-cell component —
  the component itself was confirmed unused as a `renderEditCell` anywhere
  and removed. The file now only holds the shared
  `parseGermanDateText`/`formatDateAsGerman` helpers that `DateEditCell`
  imports.
- **`SearchableSelectEditCell`** wraps an MUI Autocomplete for single-select
  columns with large option lists (cultures, suppliers) that a plain
  `singleSelect` dropdown wouldn't make browsable; `columns.tsx` also
  exposes a `createSingleSelectColumn` builder (plain dropdown) for
  short option lists — pick whichever builder matches the option-list size,
  don't default to the searchable one everywhere. The plain editor renders
  through `StandardSingleSelectEditCell`, which reuses the shared closed
  Select typeahead hook from `components/inputs/selectTypeahead.ts` so typing
  on a focused closed editor selects by the localized visible label just like
  form-level Selects.

## Keyboard editing/navigation inside the grid

`docs/keyboard-architecture.md` still lists "applying the region-shortcut
pattern to DataGrid" as future work for the *page-level* keyboard model —
that's still true. But cell-level Tab/Arrow/Enter/F2 navigation
(`keyboardEditing.ts` + `keyboardNavigation.ts`) is fully implemented:

- **`keyboardNavigation.ts`** — pure helpers (grid-API-agnostic, easy to
  unit test) for stepping Tab/Shift+Tab/Left/Right across visible, editable
  columns, and Up/Down across rows — falling back to the nearest navigable
  cell in the target row if the same column isn't editable there (so Enter
  after editing one column doesn't get stuck on a read-only next-row cell).
  When navigation lands inside a row that is already in edit mode, the shared
  focus helper focuses the target cell's actual editor input instead of only
  the DataGrid cell wrapper; otherwise the cell can look focused while
  printable keystrokes are ignored.
- **`keyboardEditing.ts`**'s `useSpreadsheetEditStarter` implements
  Excel-like "just start typing" (a printable keydown on a non-editing
  cell immediately opens edit mode and *replaces* the cell's value with the
  typed character, buffering rapid keystrokes typed before the edit-cell
  component has actually mounted) and F2 (opens edit mode *without*
  altering the value — the standard spreadsheet distinction between the
  two). The same starter also handles the row-edit edge case where Tab or
  Shift+Tab has visibly focused another editable cell but DOM focus is still
  on the cell container rather than the mounted editor input: the first
  printable key is still captured, buffered, and written into that target
  cell instead of being lost. If the editor input itself already owns DOM
  focus, its native input event is left untouched; restarting row edit mode
  there would discard other unsynchronized values in a newly created row. The
  hierarchy's name and dimension editors disable MUI's default input debounce
  because row-level validation across rapidly edited fields can otherwise
  complete out of order and restore an older value after a focus change.
- Notes cells (see below) are deliberately excluded from both spreadsheet
  auto-edit-start and the F2 flow — Enter/Space on a notes cell opens the
  notes drawer instead.

## Hover actions / row actions / context menu

Triggers: right-click, the `ContextMenu` keyboard key / `Shift+F10`, and a
550ms touch long-press (with a `.ofp-row-long-press` visual affordance
during the hold). All three funnel into the same
`hooks/useDataGridRowActionMenu.ts` state machine, positioned either at the
mouse coordinates or the focused cell's bounding rect. Menu contents:
caller-supplied row actions (duplicate/delete by default) plus
"copy row"/"copy table" (see below). Closing the menu restores keyboard
focus to whatever opened it.

Use `components/contextMenu/CustomContextMenu.tsx` for the rendered menu
shell instead of repeating MUI's `hideBackdrop`, pointer-events, paper class,
`anchorReference`, and optional list-focus props in each page. Use
`useContextMenuPositionState.ts` for positioned chart-style menus, and
`useRowContextMenuState.ts` when the menu should restore focus to the row or
cell that opened it.

A first-run **discovery hint** (`ContextMenuHint.tsx` /
`useContextMenuHint.ts`) shows a small "right-click a row" banner once,
only on fine-pointer desktop viewports, persisted per-user in
`localStorage` and synced across tabs — this is UX polish, not
functionality; don't remove the dismissal persistence when touching it.

Separately, `renderInlineActionCell` overlays icon buttons directly inside
one cell on row hover — this is the "hover actions" surface distinct from
the right-click menu.

**`FieldsBedsHierarchy.tsx`'s `useHierarchyContextMenu.ts` is a separate
implementation of the same right-click/long-press pattern**, because that
page uses a raw `<DataGrid>`, not `EditableDataGrid`, and needs different
data shapes (three row types/APIs, whole-row-object state) that
`EditableDataGrid` has no concept of. It shares its open/close/reposition
state machine, focus restoration, menu shell, and long-press timer with
`useDataGridRowActionMenu.ts` via small, tree-agnostic helpers
(`components/contextMenu/useRowContextMenuState.ts`,
`CustomContextMenu.tsx`, `useLongPressTimer.ts`), but the trigger conditions
and row-data wiring around that shared core are deliberately separate —
treat a UX fix to
*when/how* the menu opens (or the row-type-specific actions inside it) as
*not* automatically fixing the other; only a fix to the shared
open/close/reposition/focus-restore mechanics itself applies to both.

The hierarchy grid also coordinates its notes drawer with row editing
directly: saving notes for a new or still-editing Standort/Parzelle/Beet row
first persists the current row draft with the note value, then closes the
drawer. Users should never need to click outside the grid to make a new row
exist before saving its notes.

## Notes / markdown cells

Any column listed in `EditableDataGrid`'s `notes` prop renders through
`NotesCell.tsx` instead of a normal edit cell: an icon, a plain-text
excerpt, and (unless `compactIndicator`) a hover/focus/touch-triggered
preview popover (`NotesPreviewPopover.tsx` — one shared popover instance
per grid, not one per row, opened after a 250ms hover delay). Notes are
*not* edited inline — clicking opens `NotesDrawer.tsx`, a full markdown
editor (Edit/Preview tabs, a formatting toolbar) that additionally supports
photo attachments when the column has an `attachmentNoteIdField`: capture
or pick a photo, crop it with a hand-rolled pointer-drag crop tool, and
downscale/re-encode to WebP (falling back to JPEG) client-side before
upload. `noteAttachmentsCache.ts` caches attachment fetches per note id so
re-hovering a row doesn't refetch; the drawer explicitly invalidates that
cache after upload/delete.

`markdown.ts`'s `stripCitationMarkers` strips AI-citation markers of the
form `【digits†identifier】` from note text. **Unclear/needs check**: trace
where such markers actually get inserted (an LLM-assisted import/enrichment
path elsewhere in the app, presumably) before documenting the "why" further
— it wasn't found in the files reviewed for this doc.

## Copy/paste

Copy-only today (no paste-in). `tableClipboard.ts` formats selected rows as
tab/newline-delimited text (dates localized `de-DE`, arrays joined with
`, `); `TableCopyMenuItems.tsx` adds "Copy row" (header + the right-clicked
row) and "Copy table" (header + every currently loaded/filtered/sorted row)
to the row-action menu — both paste directly into Excel/Sheets.

## Column visibility

Column show/hide is handled entirely by **MUI's native columns panel**
today. A custom show/hide menu and a separate ResizeObserver-driven
"autofit" responsive-hiding feature both existed earlier and were
deliberately removed in favor of it (see the git history around
`Replace custom column show/hide menu with MUI's native columns panel` and
`Fold responsive column hiding into the native visibility model`) — do not
reintroduce a bespoke visibility UI. `EditableDataGrid` only passes
`columnVisibilityModel`/`onColumnVisibilityModelChange` straight through to
the underlying MUI grid; the actual state lives in the page via
`useColumnVisibility(...)` (`frontend/src/hooks/useColumnVisibility.ts`),
which persists to `localStorage` under `tableColumns.<tableKey>` and
supports a `defaultHiddenFieldsOnSmallScreen` list that only applies until
the user makes their *first* explicit visibility choice — after that, the
user's choice always wins regardless of screen size.

`FieldsBedsHierarchy.tsx` (raw `<DataGrid>`) has **no column-visibility
feature at all** today — this was an explicit scope cut when the feature
was migrated to the native panel elsewhere, not an oversight to "fix" as a
drive-by change.

## Row history / versioning — not a grid feature

Culture version history (backed by the generic `EntityRevision` model, see
[versioning-and-history.md](./versioning-and-history.md)) is shown in a
**standalone MUI `Dialog`** on `Cultures.tsx`, populated via
`cultureAPI.history(...)`. It does not surface inside any grid cell,
row-action menu, or notes drawer — if you're asked to "show history in the
grid," that's new work, not exposing something that already half-exists.

## Cross-cutting utilities

- `dataGridUtils.tsx` — `isUnsavedDraftRow` (heuristic for local-only,
  not-yet-saved rows), `SaveBlockedError` (lets `onBeforeSaveRow` silently
  keep a row in edit mode without surfacing an error), `prepareDataGridColumn`
  (applies the default date edit cell and makes unsaved draft rows immune
  to active column filters), `getSortedRowIds`/`orderRowsByStableIds`
  (rows are kept in a stable client-side order rather than trusting the
  grid's own post-edit row order).
- `handlers.ts` — `handleRowEditStop` deliberately suppresses MUI's default
  Escape-triggers-save-attempt behavior so Escape reliably means "cancel";
  see `AUTOSAVE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for how the blur-triggered save itself
  works.
- `styles.ts` — the single `dataGridSx` object defining every `ofp-*` CSS
  class referenced above (`.ofp-row-editing`, `.ofp-cell-dirty`,
  `.ofp-cell-error`, `.ofp-row-long-press`, ...).

## What to check before changing this layer

- If you change *when/how* the row-action menu opens or keyboard-navigation
  behavior, check whether `FieldsBedsHierarchy.tsx`'s implementation needs
  the same change (see above) — only the shared
  `useRowContextMenuState`/`useLongPressTimer` mechanics are common; a fix
  to trigger conditions or row-type wiring in one does not apply to the
  other automatically.
- Keep new edit cells consistent with the "preserve raw input text, defer
  normalization to save time" pattern used by the existing custom edit
  cells, rather than coercing on every keystroke.
- Don't reintroduce a custom column-visibility UI; extend
  `useColumnVisibility`/the native panel instead.
- Notes columns must stay `editable: false` and excluded from the
  spreadsheet auto-edit-start/F2 flow — they have their own editor.
