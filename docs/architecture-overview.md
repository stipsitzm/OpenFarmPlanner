# Architecture Overview

OpenFarmPlanner is a Django REST Framework backend plus a React/TypeScript
single-page frontend, in one repository. This doc gives a developer or AI
agent enough of a mental model to navigate the codebase and reason about
where a change belongs. For setup/commands see the root
[`README.md`](../README.md); for the data model see
[data-model.md](./data-model.md).

## Tech stack

**Backend** (`backend/`)
- Python 3.12+, Django 5.2, Django REST Framework
- SQLite by default in development, PostgreSQL supported via env config
- PDM for dependency/script management (no `pip`/`requirements.txt`)

**Frontend** (`frontend/`)
- React 19 + TypeScript, built with Vite
- Material UI (MUI + MUI X DataGrid)
- React Router (data router API, `createBrowserRouter`)
- Plain `async`/`await` + component-local `useState`/`useEffect` for data
  fetching — there is no React Query/SWR/RTK-Query layer
- Vitest + Testing Library (unit/integration), Playwright (E2E)

## Backend structure

- **`farm`** is the main domain app: nearly every model and viewset for
  locations, fields, beds, cultures, suppliers, planting plans, tasks, seed
  demand, and history/versioning lives here (`backend/farm/models.py`,
  `views.py`, `serializers.py`).
- **`accounts`** owns the Django `User` lifecycle: registration/activation,
  password reset, per-user project settings (`UserProjectSettings`:
  default/last project), account deletion with a grace period, and
  document-consent tracking. There is no custom `AUTH_USER_MODEL`.
- **`crops`** is a real Django app but defines **no models** — it's a
  read-only API surface (`/api/crops/`) over `farm.PublicCulture`, kept
  deliberately one-directional (crops never imports from farm) in
  preparation for a future public Crop Library. It exists *alongside* the
  older `/api/public-cultures/` endpoint, which the frontend still uses
  today. Full reasoning: [crop-library-architecture.md](./crop-library-architecture.md).
- Views follow a thin-view convention (AGENTS.md): business logic goes into
  `backend/farm/services/*.py` (e.g. `services_area.py` for bed-area
  math, `services/seed_packages.py` for the seed-package optimizer,
  `services/public_cultures.py` for the publish/import bridge) rather than
  living in view methods.
- Physical measurements (area, spacing, seed rates) are stored in SI units
  internally (m², m, g) and converted only at API/serializer boundaries —
  see [seed-demand-calculation.md](./seed-demand-calculation.md) for where
  this convention is and isn't consistently followed.

## Frontend structure

- **Routing** (`App.tsx`): a single data router. Public routes
  (`pages/public/` — landing/imprint/privacy, `pages/auth/` —
  login/register/activation/password reset) render outside any auth check.
  Everything under `/app/*` is nested inside a single `<ProtectedRoute />`
  element, which gates on auth-loading state, redirects unauthenticated
  users to `/login`, and — before rendering the app — forces acceptance of
  any pending legal consents via `<ConsentGate />`.
- **Pages** (`frontend/src/pages/`), one per main route:

  | Page | Route | Purpose |
  |---|---|---|
  | `Dashboard.tsx` | `/app/dashboard` | Landing page / setup checklist |
  | `Locations.tsx` | `/app/locations` | Manage farm locations (Standorte) |
  | `FieldsBedsPage.tsx` / `FieldsBedsHierarchy.tsx` / `GraphicalFields.tsx` | `/app/fields-beds` | Fields & beds: hierarchy (tree) view and graphical (map) view |
  | `Cultures.tsx` | `/app/cultures` | Manage project cultures; Public Culture Library import/export and version history |
  | `PlantingPlans.tsx` | `/app/anbauplaene` (alias `/app/planting-plans`) | Spreadsheet-like editable grid of planting schedules |
  | `GanttChart.tsx` | `/app/gantt-chart` | Bed-occupancy timeline / seedling calendar |
  | `YieldOverview.tsx` | `/app/yield-overview` | Aggregated harvest/yield overview |
  | `SeedDemand.tsx` | `/app/seed-demand` | Seed quantity/package requirement per culture |
  | `Suppliers.tsx` | `/app/suppliers` | Manage seed/plant suppliers |
  | `ProjectSelectionPage.tsx` | `/app/project-selection` | Pick/create/restore a project |
  | `ProjectSettingsPage.tsx` | `/app/project-settings` | Rename/delete project, manage members & invitations |
  | `AccountSettingsPage.tsx` | `/app/account-settings` | Account details, email/password change, deletion |

  `pages/InvitationPage.tsx` looks unrouted/superseded by
  `InvitationAcceptPage.tsx` — **unclear/needs check** before assuming it's
  dead code.

- **API layer** (`frontend/src/api/`): `httpClient.ts` is the one shared
  axios instance; a single request interceptor attaches `X-Project-Id`
  (read fresh from `localStorage` per request) and `X-CSRFToken`.
  `api.ts` groups REST calls into per-domain objects (`cultureAPI`,
  `plantingPlanAPI`, `seedDemandAPI`, ...) on top of that client.
  `auth/authApi.ts` is a **separate**, hand-rolled `fetch`-based client used
  only for auth endpoints (login/register/session), independent of the
  project-header interceptor. This means there are two independent
  error-message-normalization implementations (`api/errors.ts` for the
  axios client, `authApi.ts`'s own for the auth client) — a known
  duplication, not a bug, if you're looking for "the" error handler.
- **i18n**: one JSON namespace per feature area under
  `frontend/src/i18n/locales/{de,en}/`. German is complete (16 namespaces);
  English is partial (8 namespaces) and falls back to German for anything
  missing (`fallbackLng: 'de'`). Treat English as "started, not shipped."
- **Keyboard navigation & commands**: a focus-region model plus a
  shortcut/command system — see
  [keyboard-architecture.md](./keyboard-architecture.md).
- **The custom DataGrid layer**: most editable tables use a shared
  `EditableDataGrid` wrapper around MUI X DataGrid with inline editing,
  autosave-on-blur, row actions, and notes — see
  [datagrid-architecture.md](./datagrid-architecture.md). Not every grid
  page uses it — `FieldsBedsHierarchy.tsx` renders a raw MUI `DataGrid`
  directly with its own, independently-implemented context-menu and
  keyboard-navigation logic; treat the two as parallel, not shared,
  implementations when changing either one.

## Project, user, and permission model

- A `Project` is the tenant boundary; a `User` gets access only via a
  `ProjectMembership` (role: `admin` or `member` — no finer-grained
  permission system exists).
- Every project-scoped API request must carry an `X-Project-Id` header.
  `ProjectScopedMixin` (`backend/farm/views.py`) resolves and validates it
  once per request, then auto-scopes the queryset and auto-injects the
  project on create — this is the actual multi-tenancy enforcement point,
  not something each view re-implements.
- On the frontend, the active project id is tracked in `AuthContext`
  (seeded from the server-resolved `resolved_project_id` on login/refresh),
  persisted to `localStorage['activeProjectId']`, and read fresh by the
  axios interceptor on every request. Switching projects
  (`switchActiveProject`) calls a dedicated endpoint, updates that storage
  key, and then does a full `window.location.reload()` — a deliberate
  choice to guarantee no page holds stale cross-project state, rather than
  relying on React state propagation alone.
- A rare **agent-mode** session type (`AgentLoginToken`, superuser-created)
  locks a session to one specific project regardless of the `X-Project-Id`
  header sent, and is explicitly never treated as admin even if the
  underlying user is one — used for automation/agent tooling access, not
  regular users.
- Full model relationships: [data-model.md](./data-model.md#1-projects-users-and-access).

## Notable architecture & UX decisions worth knowing before changing things

These are decisions already made deliberately — see AGENTS.md's
"Architecture Safety Rules": don't change established UX behavior without
an explicit request, and search for the existing pattern before introducing
a new one.

- **History is snapshot-based, not event-sourced.** `EntityRevision`
  stores full JSON snapshots per mutation, not deltas to replay. See
  [versioning-and-history.md](./versioning-and-history.md).
- **The Crop Library split already exists in the data model** (`Culture` is
  project-owned, `PublicCulture` is shared) but is only partially exposed
  as its own app/route today — see
  [crop-library-architecture.md](./crop-library-architecture.md) before
  assuming `/api/public-cultures/` can be renamed or removed.
- **Large datasets use windowed rendering, not virtualization inside the
  vendored Gantt library** (which doesn't virtualize on its own) — see
  [large-dataset-rendering.md](./large-dataset-rendering.md).
- **Column visibility is now handled entirely by MUI's native columns
  panel**, not a custom show/hide menu — a custom implementation was
  deliberately removed in favor of it (see
  [datagrid-architecture.md](./datagrid-architecture.md#column-visibility)).
  Don't reintroduce a bespoke column-visibility UI on `EditableDataGrid`.
- **Deployment/infrastructure live in a separate repository**
  (`OpenFarmPlanner-ops`) — this repo intentionally has no Dockerfile,
  deploy scripts, or cron config for production use.

## Unclear / needs check

- Whether `ProjectMembership.role` gates any *frontend* UI beyond simple
  display (no explicit role-based conditionals were found in the pages
  reviewed while writing this doc) — verify before documenting a frontend
  permission model that doesn't actually exist yet.
- Whether a 401 mid-session (expired Django session while the user is
  active on an `/app/*` page) triggers any global logout/redirect — no
  global 401 interceptor was found; this is based on static reading, not an
  observed runtime session-expiry test.
