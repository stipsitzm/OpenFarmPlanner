# Work Hours OpenFarmPlanner

Overview of work hours on the OpenFarmPlanner project based on Git commits and GitHub interactions.

**Note:** This tracking system uses activity bridging with a 1-hour gap threshold. All GitHub activities (commits, PR comments, issue comments, reviews) within 1 hour are considered part of the same work session. Sessions starting with commits begin 60 minutes earlier to account for pre-commit work.

## Notes

- Times are calculated based on GitHub activity timestamps (commits, PR comments, issue comments, reviews)
- **Activity Bridging**: Activities within 1 hour are considered part of the same work session
- **Commit Pre-work**: Sessions starting with commits begin 60 minutes earlier to account for coding before commit
- **Manual Editing**: You can edit `arbeitszeiten_editable.csv` directly. Set "Manually Edited?" to "Yes" to preserve your changes
- Machine-readable data: see `arbeitszeiten_editable.csv` (primary source) and `arbeitszeiten.csv` (legacy format)
- Automatically generated by GitHub Actions

## How to Manually Edit Work Hours

1. Open `docs/arbeitszeiten_editable.csv`
2. Edit the Duration, Activity, or Notes fields as needed
3. Set "Manually Edited?" to "Yes" for any rows you modify
4. Commit and push your changes
5. The script will preserve your manual edits on the next run
