# Demo Project Template

OpenFarmPlanner defines its reusable demo project data in
`backend/farm/services/demo_project.py`.

The service has two entry points:

- `create_personal_demo_project(user=...)` creates one normal, editable
  project for the authenticated user and is used by first-project onboarding
  and the project switcher's explicit "load demo project" action.
- `create_or_reset_demo_project(...)` recreates the local screenshot/demo
  fixture used by the management command and landing-page screenshot workflow.

The template currently creates the `Solawi Sonnenacker` project with two
locations, four fields, twelve beds, three suppliers, eight vegetable cultures,
seed package data, and twelve planting plans for the 2026 season. All created
records are project-scoped and owned by the receiving user through a regular
admin `ProjectMembership`.

The frontend opens the first-project onboarding automatically only while the
authenticated user's project membership list is empty. Once the user has at
least one project, onboarding is available only through the project switcher's
explicit restart action; loading the demo project remains a separate action.
The onboarding screen itself stays focused on starting a project. Deleted
projects are restored or permanently deleted through the project switcher's
trash entry, which opens the existing project trash view.

To adjust the template, update the specs in `demo_project.py` and extend the
focused backend tests in `backend/farm/tests/test_demo_project.py`. The project
API behavior is covered in `backend/farm/tests/test_projects_api.py`; the
frontend onboarding choice is covered in
`frontend/src/__tests__/ProjectSelectionPage.test.tsx` and
`frontend/e2e/onboarding-demo-project.spec.ts`.

Landing-page screenshots are generated from this same template and currently
cover areas, crops, calendar planning, yield overview, and seed demand.

Local checks:

```bash
cd backend
pdm run test farm/tests/test_demo_project.py farm/tests/test_projects_api.py

cd ../frontend
npx vitest run src/__tests__/ProjectSelectionPage.test.tsx
npx playwright test e2e/onboarding-demo-project.spec.ts
```

For the standalone local demo user/project used outside onboarding:

```bash
cd backend
pdm run python manage.py seed_demo_project
```
