# Crop Library / Farm Planning Architecture

Date: 2026-07-03
Scope: `backend/`, `frontend/src/`

Goal: prepare and evolve the architecture for a public Crop Library
(`/crops`) without splitting the repository unnecessarily. The library is
now treated as a long-lived, community-built knowledge base for crop data.
Users can withdraw their own accidental publications through a non-destructive
status transition; moderation and cleanup use stronger staff-only states.
The first collaborative editing slice is now also in place: public entries
have discussion comments and reviewed change proposals, while the import
picker stays optimized for quickly copying a crop into the active project.

## 0. Product and legal model

The public Crop Library follows an open-data model:

- Published crop data becomes part of a shared knowledge base intended to
  persist beyond the contributing user's project or account.
- Contributors may withdraw their own publications when a publication was
  accidental or needs correction. Withdrawal is non-destructive: the entry
  disappears from discovery, but attribution, license evidence, import
  lineage, and already-imported project copies remain intact.
- Moderator removal is reserved for exceptional cases such as test data,
  duplicates, unlawful content, personal data in a published record, spam,
  obvious abuse, or another moderation decision. It is also non-destructive.
- Public entries are not edited directly by ordinary users. Users discuss an
  entry and submit reviewed change proposals; staff/moderators can approve a
  proposal, which applies allowlisted fields to the public master row and
  increments its version. This keeps the workflow collaborative while
  preserving auditability.
- Public crop data is intended to be reusable through the app, future
  public APIs, future downloads/exports, and external open-source or
  commercial projects.
- Contributions are licensed under Creative Commons
  Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0). The license is
  suitable here because it allows copying, adaptation, redistribution, and
  commercial use while preserving attribution and share-alike conditions.
- A user's first publication must be a conscious act: the UI explains the
  persistence and license terms, and the backend records acceptance as
  `DocumentConsent.DOCUMENT_PUBLIC_LIBRARY`. This contribution consent is
  separate from the global Terms consent so it can be versioned and audited
  without blocking users who never publish.

Moderation uses non-destructive state transitions (`draft`, `published`,
`withdrawn`, `removed`) over hard deletes, so attribution, license evidence,
import lineage, and revision history remain auditable where legally
permissible. Hard delete is intentionally exceptional and only available to
administrators when no imports, source-project provenance, or other
dependencies remain.

Discussion comments (`PublicCultureDiscussionComment`) and change proposals
(`PublicCultureChangeProposal`) are child records of `PublicCulture`. They do
not touch project-owned `Culture` rows. Approving a proposal changes only the
shared public-library row; projects that already imported an entry continue
using their private copied snapshot until a future explicit update/merge flow
is built.

## 1. The current situation (before this pass)

The domain split the long-term vision asks for — a public Crop Library
vs. project-scoped Farm Planning — **already existed at the data model
level**, just not as a formalized service/app boundary:

- **`Culture`** (`backend/farm/models/cultures.py`) is project-owned: it has a
  required `project` FK. Every project has its own private copy of every
  variety it grows, with growing parameters, supplier links, seed
  packages, and revision history (`CultureRevision`). This is Farm
  Planning data.
- **`PublicCulture`** (same file) is the shared library: no `project` FK
  of its own, only nullable *provenance* links (`source_project_culture`,
  `source_project`) recording where a published entry came from. This is
  Crop Library data.
- A bridge, `backend/farm/services/public_cultures.py`, copies data both
  ways: `publish_culture_to_public_library()` (a project's `Culture` →
  the library) and `import_public_culture_into_project()` (a library
  entry → a new project-owned `Culture`).
- `PublicCultureViewSet` (`/api/public-cultures/`) was already read-only
  and required only authentication — no project scoping at all, since a
  published crop isn't owned by any one project.
- The frontend already has an equivalent precedent for "routes outside
  the authenticated app": `frontend/src/pages/public/` (landing page,
  imprint, privacy policy) and `frontend/src/pages/auth/` (login,
  registration, ...) both render outside `/app`, gated only by
  `<ProtectedRoute />` wrapping the `/app` branch specifically. `/app` is
  already the prefix for the entire authenticated Farm Planning app; `/`
  is already the public root.

So the real work here was formalizing an existing, correct data split
into an explicit service/app boundary — not inventing the split from
scratch.

## 2. What this pass added

### Backend — a new `crops` Django app

`backend/crops/` is a real Django app (`INSTALLED_APPS`). It now owns
`CropSpecies`, the official language-independent species list used at the
publishing boundary. `PublicCulture` stays in `farm.models` — moving that
existing model to a different app changes its migration state and (without
careful `SeparateDatabaseAndState` migrations) its `app_label`-derived
`db_table`. That's a real risk to existing data, and still isn't
justified until the crop library is actually extracted into its own
service.

```
backend/crops/
  apps.py          CropsConfig
  models.py        CropSpecies, the official species list used by the
                    Publishing Wizard
  services.py      list_published_crops(), get_published_crop(),
                    find_exact_crop_match() — reads farm.models.PublicCulture,
                    nothing else
  serializers.py   CropSerializer (read-only; deliberately excludes
                    source_project/source_project_culture — see §3)
  views.py         CropViewSet (ReadOnlyModelViewSet, IsAuthenticated)
                    CropSpeciesViewSet (official list + proposed entries)
  urls.py          router → included at /api/crops/
  tests/
```

This is **additive**: `/api/public-cultures/` keeps working exactly as
before (still defined in `farm/cultures/views.py`/`farm/urls.py`, untouched) —
the current frontend keeps using it. `/api/crops/` and `/api/crops/<id>/`
are new, parallel endpoints with the same `IsAuthenticated` requirement
as everything else — **not actually public yet**. Making them public
later is a one-line permission-class change, not a rewrite.

`config/settings.py` (`INSTALLED_APPS`) and `config/urls.py` (both the
plain and legacy-prefixed mounts, matching how `farm.urls` is already
double-mounted) were updated to register the new app.

### Frontend — `frontend/src/crops/`

```
frontend/src/crops/
  api/cropsApi.ts        new client for /api/crops (list/get/match) —
                         NOT wired into any page yet
  components/
    PublicCultureLibraryDialog.tsx   moved from src/cultures/ (see §3)
  pages/                 empty (README explains what goes here later)
  hooks/                 empty (README explains what goes here later)
  index.ts               barrel (mirrors src/cultures/index.ts's convention
                         of exporting only the public-facing pieces)
```

`cropsApi.ts` exists so future code has somewhere to import from, but
`Cultures.tsx` / `PublicCultureLibraryDialog` still call the existing
`publicCultureAPI` in `api/api.ts` — switching the data source is a
separate, deliberate future step (see §5), not bundled into this
architecture pass.

`App.tsx` now exposes `/app/crop-library` (with `/app/crops` as an alias) as
an authenticated full-page library workspace. The existing
`PublicCultureLibraryDialog` remains the quick import picker from the project
Cultures page and links to the full page for discussion and reviewed
changes.

## 3. The domain rule, and where it bites

> "Die Crop Library darf keinerlei Wissen über Projekte besitzen. Die
> Projektlogik darf lediglich die Crop Library verwenden."

Applied concretely:

- `crops/services.py`, `crops/serializers.py`, `crops/views.py` import
  only `farm.models.PublicCulture` and `farm.utils.normalize_text` — never
  farm's view/serializer packages, `Project`, or `Culture`. This is the
  one dependency direction that matters: if `crops` ever imported from
  farm's serializers, the arrow would point the wrong way (crop library
  depending on farm planning).
- `crops/serializers.py`'s `CropSerializer` is **not** a re-export or
  subclass of `farm.cultures.serializers.PublicCultureSerializer`, even though
  they're currently near-identical — importing it would create exactly
  that backwards dependency. It's a small, deliberate duplication.
- `CropSerializer` also deliberately **excludes**
  `source_project_culture`/`source_project` (present in the legacy
  `PublicCultureSerializer`) — those are project-provenance fields, and
  exposing them on the crop-library-facing surface would leak Farm
  Planning knowledge outward.
- The publish/import bridge itself (`farm/services/public_cultures.py`)
  is **not** moved into `crops`. It inherently needs both `Culture` and
  `Project` — it's a bridge, not a pure citizen of either domain. It's
  called "farm's dependency on the crop library" already (`farm/cultures/views.py`
  imports it), which is the correct direction; deciding whether it should
  someday become a real network call (once crops is an actual separate
  service) is future work, documented in §5, not solved now.
- `frontend/src/pages/usePublicCultureLibrary.ts` — the hook driving
  publish/import from the Cultures page — stays in `pages/` for the same
  reason: it's the Farm-Planning-side integration point, not
  crop-library-only logic (it reads/writes a project's `Culture` and
  needs a `selectedCulture`/`onImportSuccess` callback tied to that
  page's state).
- `frontend/src/cultures/CultureDetail.tsx` also stays where it is: it's
  reusable, prop-driven code, but the *data* it displays (a project's own
  cultures) is Farm Planning data, not the library. Only
  `PublicCultureLibraryDialog.tsx` — which genuinely only ever renders
  `PublicCulture[]` — moved to `crops/components/`.

## 4. Naming

New code in `crops/` uses "Crop" (`CropSerializer`, `CropViewSet`,
`cropsApi`, `Crop` type alias) per the task's naming rule. Existing
backend fields/models/endpoints (`Culture`, `PublicCulture`,
`/api/cultures/`, `/api/public-cultures/`) were **not** renamed — the
task explicitly allows deferring "umfangreiche Umbenennungen" rather than
risking them, and renaming a Django model/db column/serializer field
touches migrations, the DRF response shape, and every frontend call site
for no functional benefit right now. German UI text (`"Kultur"`,
`"Kulturbibliothek"`) is untouched, as required.

## 5. Deliberately NOT done (and why)

| Not done | Why | Future path |
|---|---|---|
| Moving `PublicCulture` (or `Culture`) into `crops.models` | Changes migration state / `app_label`-derived `db_table`; real risk to existing data for zero current benefit | A dedicated migration using `SeparateDatabaseAndState` to move the model's Django state into `crops` while keeping (or explicitly renaming, in one controlled step) the actual table |
| Removing/renaming `/api/public-cultures/` | Would break the current frontend (`publicCultureAPI`) — a functional change the task forbids | Once `Cultures.tsx`/`PublicCultureLibraryDialog` are switched to `cropsApi`/`/api/crops`, deprecate and remove the legacy path |
| Switching the frontend to actually call `/api/crops` | Not required to "prepare" the architecture, and swapping a working data source is exactly the kind of change to do deliberately and separately, with its own testing pass | Point `Cultures.tsx` at `cropsApi` instead of `publicCultureAPI`, delete the old client, delete `/api/public-cultures/` |
| A public, unauthenticated `/crops` route/page | The current collaboration and import workflow still needs an authenticated user and active project context | Split browsing from importing later: expose read-only public pages under `/crops`, keep project import under `/app` |
| Splitting `i18n/locales/*/cultures.json` into a `crops` namespace | Namespace holds both library- and farm-planning-flavored strings today; splitting now is pure churn for zero user-visible benefit | Split when `crops/pages/` gets real UI text to hold |
| Moving `Culture`/`CultureViewSet`/`CultureSupplierData`/`SeedPackage` into `crops` | These are genuinely Farm Planning (project-owned, or only meaningful attached to a project-owned `Culture`) — moving them would be the large, risky refactor the task asks to avoid | Not planned; these belong in Farm Planning long-term too |
| Fixing `PublicCultureLibraryDialog.tsx`'s cross-import of `stripCitationMarkers` from `components/data-grid/markdown`, or its two pre-existing `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` lint errors | Both pre-date this move (confirmed by lint-checking the file at its old path before moving it) — fixing them isn't in scope for an architecture-only pass | A future cleanup could move the markdown helper to a shared, domain-neutral location |

## 6. Current user-facing surfaces

- Every existing API path (`/api/cultures/...`, `/api/public-cultures/...`)
  still works. New collaboration actions are additive child endpoints on
  `/api/public-cultures/<id>/`.
- The project Cultures page still uses `PublicCultureLibraryDialog` for quick
  import into the active project.
- `/app/crop-library` is the full authenticated library workspace for
  browsing, importing, discussing entries, and proposing/reviewing changes.

## 7. Publishing Wizard quality gate

Publishing a project-owned `Culture` is no longer a direct copy action from
the Cultures page. The frontend opens `CulturesPublishingWizardDialog`,
which keeps the normal path intentionally small: the user selects the
official `CropSpecies`, confirms the original language, and clicks publish.
The dialog calls `/api/cultures/<id>/publish-public/preview/` only as a
background validation step when the user attempts publication, then shows
only actionable problems:

- official `CropSpecies` selected;
- exactly one original language selected (defaulted from the UI language);
- public-library required fields complete; and
- no published public duplicate for the same `CropSpecies` + normalized
  variety.

Missing translations remain optional and are not shown as a normal blocking
step. The existing CC BY-SA public-library contribution consent is also not
shown permanently; if it has not already been accepted, the dialog reveals it
immediately before the final publication action.

The backend enforces the same checks in
`farm.services.public_cultures.publish_culture_to_public_library()`, so the
wizard is not only a UI affordance. Private project cultures remain
flexible: `Culture.crop_species` is nullable, and incomplete project
cultures can still be created and edited. The strictness lives at the
public-library boundary where durable shared data is created. The official
species dropdown is seeded from `crops.seed_data.CROP_SPECIES_SEED_DATA`, a
central starter catalogue for common German and Austrian crop species whose
entries already carry stable keys and translation maps for the future
multilingual species library.

## 8. Withdrawal, removal, and hard delete

`PublicCulture.status` models the public-library lifecycle:

- `draft`: reserved for future review workflows;
- `published`: visible and importable from the public library;
- `withdrawn`: hidden by the contributor who published it;
- `removed`: hidden by an administrator or moderator with a required reason.

The status-change API lives on `/api/public-cultures/<id>/`:

- `withdraw/` lets the contributor withdraw their own published entry.
- `remove/` lets staff remove an entry with a structured reason
  (`accidental_publication`, `test_data`, `duplicate`, `wrong_mapping`,
  `unlawful_content`, `other`).
- `hard-delete/` is staff-only and intentionally narrow. It is blocked when
  the public entry has imported project copies or source-project provenance;
  ordinary cleanup and moderation should use `removed` instead.
  Because it is exceptional, the normal culture overflow menu does not expose
  hard delete; it should live in a dedicated moderation/admin surface if a
  human-facing UI is needed later.

Every status transition writes `PublicCultureStatusEvent`, establishing the
audit trail needed for later moderation queues, review steps, duplicate
merges, restore actions, or richer status history. Public lists, duplicate
checks, match endpoints, and imports only expose `published` rows. Project
imports remain protected because importing creates a private `Culture` copy
with its own fields; status changes on `PublicCulture` never mutate already
imported project data.
